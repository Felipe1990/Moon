A few days before election I figured it could be interesting to have a little glimpse of what are the candidates talking about. As source I took their twits from the last two weeks. All the analysis was conducted using R.

Presidential candidates considered: Sergio Fajardo, Iván Duque, Humberto de la Calle and Germán Vargas.
